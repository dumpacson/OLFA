## Introduction

OLFA is an interactive chatting platform designed specifically for IIUM students to facilitate communication and foster a sense of community among residents of different mahallahs. This platform offers a convenient and engaging way for students to connect, exchange information, and share experiences with their peers across various mahallahs within the IIUM campus.
With the OLFA platform, IIUM students can participate in real-time chat conversations with fellow students from different mahallahs.
