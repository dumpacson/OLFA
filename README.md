## Introduction

The system aims to provide information on all the process that goes into a blood donation. The system will also provide the functionality of registering online to new donors and making an appointment to avoid wasting time.<br/><br/>
Already registered donors can also see all their past donations in one view making it easy if they ever want to look through and check.<br/><br/>
On the admin/staff side, they can view the details of all the donations made and the details of all the donors in 2 separate views. They can handle the data needed to manage blood donations and donor's information. There will also be a view of all the available blood bags in the bank.<br></br>
